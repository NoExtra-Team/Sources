SINK LIVE FROM THE BEACH BECAUSE IT'S STARTING TO GET WARM IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE. I HOPE YOU LIKE THIS SCREEN BUT TO REALLY APPRECIATE IT, WE WILL REPEAT IT EVERY TIME, YOU HAVE TO SEE IT ON A REAL ATARI MONITOR BECAUSE THE HEAT OF THE ANALOG, THE SCANLINES, ETC.. IT CHANGES EVERYTHING! AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE SOUND! BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT TIME PASSES AND THAT NOT EVERYONE HAS THIS KIND OF MATERIAL AT HOME ANYMORE. THE GOAL OF ALL THIS IS SIMPLY THE PASSION WE HAVE IN HMD AND SURELY LIKE YOU, TO CONTINUE TO MAKE THIS OLD MACHINE LIVE WHICH MADE US SPEND SO MANY GOOD MOMENTS AND CREATION OF FRIENDSHIP ALL AROUND THE WORLD. STAY TRUE, STAY SIMPLE, STAY ATARI.ÿ
