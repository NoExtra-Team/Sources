Yo GuyzZ! Stranger is back on the keys. I am always extremely happy and proud to be able to write a few words in a new HMD production. First of all I would like to congratulate our great GFX Artists (Dieu, Jade, Pandafox, Kenet, Nytrik) who are always extremely active, you are amazing, thanks to your pixels you manage to give inspiration and motivation to our coders and musicians, merci et Bravo!
